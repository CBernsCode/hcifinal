# Protostar
An application for rapidly prototyping VR interfaces. 

Inspired by : Mike Alger

By Chris Berns & Albara Mehene

## Goals
- Fast
- Easy to Learn 
- Web based 
- Near Instantaneous Changes 

## Technologies used
[**A-Frame**](https://aframe.io/) - VR stack
 - A Web framework for building VR designs 

[**React**](https://reactjs.org/) - Front end library
 - Interative UI Designs 

[**Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com/) - Authentication and realtime database
 - Sync data amount users data 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Summary:
This purpose of this of this project was to tackle problems users experience in Virtual Reality. Over a long period of time, users start to feel uncomfortable and experience motion sickness. One issue is user having to change the resoultion each time they move a diffrent distance. We wanted to create a way for the user to view a object by keeping the same screen resoultion but the Z distance would change depending on the users choice. This allows the user not needing worry about change the x & y coordinates only needing to worry about the z distance.
